# Children-At-Risk-R

Had the aspirations for the future and sense of capability of children at-risk improved under the influence of military service, and in what manner.


## Intreduction

The research “Resilience among individuals who experience childhood adversity” by Dr. Talia Schwartz-Tairy, studies the influence of social workers on children at-risk who had childhood trauma in terms of aspirations for the future, mental strength, and their sense of capability to manage adult independent living. Talia's long-time research is the first of its kind. Moreover, to date, no analysis has been performed over its last survey.
One of the parameters asked in the survey is the type of military service (if done). The Israeli military is well known as a 'melting pot' that exposes youth to diverse populations and cultures. Also, the military is a life experience in which youth become mature and get a chance to cope with bureaucracy and problem solving. Thus, we estimate that military service (military/ national) improves the sense of hope and capability of children at-risk.
